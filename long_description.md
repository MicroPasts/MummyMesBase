This application enables the creation of a high quality 3D model of an archaeological artifact via process known as
photo-masking. There has been a revolution in 3D modeling in recent years and it is now relatively easy to construct
such models from ordinary digital photographs. Isolating the object depicted in these photographs, and masking out the
background, is an important first step to achieving high quality results.

This particular photo-masking application is an experiment as we are attempting to model an Egyptian sarcophagus on display at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science (DMNS). The sarcophagus on permanent loan to DMNS from the Rosemont Museum in Pueblo, CO.


### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modeling process to concentrate on the object itself and
ignore irrelevant background information.
